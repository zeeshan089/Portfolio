              <h3>Pasarpolis India Pvt Ltd</h3>
              <h3>Tech Lead</h3>

              <ul class="work__list">
                <li>Lead and developed the Consumer product for purchase and claims of Insurance policies. Designed the architecture and implemented the Insurance Policy products purchase flow and Claims flow which allowed our customers to seamlessly purchase the policy products and make claims on the purchased policies with zero human intervention.</li>
                <li>Integrated the Agency product with the Consumer product. In the Agency product, Insurance agents are responsible for selling and claiming the policies for the customers. Designed the architecture and integrated this Agency product with Consumer product. This integration allowed all our customers to purchase and claim policies by themselves and without the need of an agent to do it.</li>
                <li>Data Archival: Organizationâ€™s database had over 10 TBs of Relational data of Insurances. Due to this, our database was very slow for normal queries and was getting timed out for large queries. I was tasked to archive the data which belonged to expired insurances, and this was around 8 TBs of data in total. I designed and implemented the data archival flow which uses BigQuery and Google cloud bucket to archive this huge datasetâ€™s expired insurances. </li>
                <li>Partner Report generation: The monthly and quarterly report generation, for our partner organizations who were selling our insurance products, was facing overload issues and was very slow in generating and sending reports. This was mainly due to the sheer size and the number of reports being generated. I redesigned and implemented the Report generation product. We benchmarked the maximum capacity of the report generation system first, and then implemented the new limitation mechanism based on that benchmarked data.</li>
                <li>I work closely with Senior management, Product managers, and other Engineering leaders for product requirements, impact analysis and to finalize product offerings.</li>
